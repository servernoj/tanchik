    h1 Background
    p
      | I was born and raised in Russia where I got my formal education and my first MS degree in Fine Arts. I moved to USA in 2008 and took some time to figure out what I wanted to do next. In 2011 I decided to get another degree in Computer Science. I completed my Master Degree in Computer Science in 2011, got Graduate Certificate in Data Management and Analytics in 2018 and still learn new ways of how to manipulate and visualize data. As of now, I am working as a Data Analyst and enjoy learning new technology that helps me to achieve my goals.
    h1 Professional Interests
    p
      | Ever since I became a CS student, I have learned different products and programming languages to store, retrieve and manipulate date: SQL Server, MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, SQL, PHP, Python, Tableau, PowerBI, SSRS, SSIS. Main technologies I use right now are SQL Server, SQL, PowerBI, Python and Python widgets to help building custom monitoring and reporting tools. Most recently, I started to implement projects that use NoSQL databases such as Elasticsearch and I am amused by the power it provides so I plan to continue learning it.
    h1 My ‘dream’ job
    p
      | I like to be challenged and find new ways to solve problems. I like all stages of working with data – starting with building data models, ETL, storing and retrieving it for reporting purposes. I would like to work at the place I can be involved in automation and development. I would appreciate working in a place where team members share their ideas and bring pros and cons for a solution of specific problem.
    h1 My ‘to-do’ list for self-development
    p
      | Right now, I’m working on learning classification and prediction models. I also want to continue learning NoSQL databases and learn how to build dashboard using Kibana and Grafana. One of the items in my ‘to-do’ list is to get my next certificate in Tableau and SQL Server.
    h1 Personal
    p
      | In my spare time, I enjoy running, hiking and martial arts. My two biggest goals are to run half-marathon by 2021 and get a black belt in taekwondo by 2022. I like reading in both languages - Russian and English.
